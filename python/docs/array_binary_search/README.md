# Challenge Title

 A function called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available in python, return the index of the arrayâ€™s element that is equal to the value of the search key, or -1 if the element is not in the array.

## Approach & Efficiency
<!-- What approach did you take? Why? What is the Big O space/time for this approach? -->

I figured the array needed to be halved until the key value was found, chat gpt assisted with the code. The big O notation would be O(log n), since the search is logarithmic.
